# SmartDroneDelivery — Database Design Report

This repository contains the LaTeX source for the **SmartDroneDelivery Database Design** report, submitted as a course assignment for the *Database Search and Design* subject at the University of Technology (UT), Ho Chi Minh City.

The report focuses exclusively on the **database design** of an AI-powered Drone Delivery Management Platform. It covers data requirements analysis, conceptual modeling (ERD), logical relational schema, normalization, physical PostgreSQL implementation, and database testing.

## Database Schema Overview

The final schema consists of **21 tables** organized into six groups:

- **User & Authorization**: `system_user`, `role`, `permission`, `user_role`, `role_permission`
- **Customer**: `customer`, `customer_address`
- **Delivery Order**: `delivery_order`, `package`, `order_status_history`
- **Delivery Execution**: `drone`, `landing_station`, `delivery_activity`, `tracking_record`, `delivery_confirmation`, `delivery_exception`, `station_status_history`
- **Audit**: `audit_log`
- **Optional**: `delivery_route`, `route_point`, `ai_recommendation`

The core design pattern is:

```
delivery_order
    └── delivery_activity ── drone
            ├── tracking_record
            └── delivery_exception
```

This pattern replaces the incorrect direct 1:1 relationship between an order and a drone, allowing multiple delivery attempts per order and full history tracking per attempt.

## Technology

- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Document**: LaTeX (pdfTeX / TeX Live 2025)
- **Key PostgreSQL features used**: `BIGINT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY`, `TIMESTAMPTZ`, `JSONB`, `INET`, `CHECK` constraints, `FOREIGN KEY` with referential actions, composite indexes

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `book.tex` in your LaTeX editor.
3. Compile with `pdflatex` (run twice to resolve cross-references):

```bash
pdflatex book.tex
pdflatex book.tex
```

The compiled output is `book.pdf`.

> **Required files** (do not modify or move):
> - `book.sty` — LaTeX style file
> - `book.bst` — BibTeX bibliography style

## Software

- Tested with **TeX Live 2025** on Windows.
- Compatible with pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX, and LuaLaTeX (font settings may differ for non-pdfTeX engines).
